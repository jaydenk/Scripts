## New Machine Setup Script

*Please don't use these - I don't know what I'm doing.*

That said, if you do for some reason want to use this script (that I have made for my own personal use) to setup a CentOS system, here you go:

>`curl -fsSL https://cnsm.ist/2IqzVZR -o setup.sh && chmod u+x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`

Have fun!
